## Introduction

This blog will be a little less on the cinematography-side than my other posts, but it is still relevant for anybody interested in cinematography. This time I will tell you about how we constructed the set for the film - _the photo booth_. 

Last year I shot a short about two people who stumble into each other in a photo booth and end up changing each others' lives. The concept of the film is that it all takes place in the photo booth and it is all shot from the perspective of the camera in the photo booth. A bold move by director _Petter SjÃ¶strand_ to have long takes with no camera movement or cutting at all in a time where films tend to move towards more movement and faster editing.

## The Build

As anybody who has worked on a film shoot knows, a controlled environment is very beneficial. This is why we can't just go out to a real photo booth and shoot the film there, there would be noise, risk of people entering frame in the middle of a scene, hard to control the lighting etc..

So we knew we had to do this in a studio. This studio ended up being a room in the basement of an apartment complex. Not a real studio - but big enough for us to fit a fake photo booth!

Next we had to figure out exactly what we had to get out of this photo booth, since we're building it ourselves from scratch we can do what we want with it.

#### We needed the photo booth to have:

* room for two people
* blocked of on all sides
* easy entry and exit
* space for camera and audio
* big enough to fit both actors into frame without using an 8mm lens

With these requirements in hand we started to plan the dimensions of the booth and the height of the chair to begin with.

{{< figure src="/img/image/4.jpg" >}}


This was our first prototype of the booth, cardboard and two fold out chairs. We started out with placing the chairs and the camera to work out the framing of the characters. We ended up using something around 14-16mm with a tokina 11-16mm lens. After we had figured out the distance between the camera and the chairs, we used the cardboard cartons to find how wide we wanted the walls to be. We wanted it to be wide enough to fit both actors but still narrow enough to feel as if we were in a small photo booth where it gets crowded if you are two people. 

We literally just sat two people in the chairs and looked in the viewfinder what width we felt was good and then wrote the dimensions down.

We ended up with 120cm*160cm and measured out 190cm height of the walls, since we're not showing the roof we didn't have to build it.

Now that we knew the dimensions of the build, all we had to work out was the details. 

When we looked at real photo booths we found that many of them had a screen behind them that lit up when the photos were taken in order to get a white background. We made a 70x70cm acrylic glass area on the wall behind our actors and put a big led light about a meter away from it in order to achieve this effect in our booth.

## Shot 1 - Bathtub
<br>
{{< figure src="/img/gtr/1.jpg" >}}

Our first shot was of the main character sitting in a bathtub.
<br>
My focus in this shot was keeping the general ambiance in the room low and to focus the eye towards our main character. To do this, I used an Area 48 with grid on it as the key light, positioned from directly above. 
This gave a nice top light on the talent while keeping light spilling on the wall behind him to a minimum. I white balanced the camera somewhere around 5000k and all lights were around 3200k, to give this nice warm look. The practical that is in frame was also changed to a low output bulb.
<br>
We added some side light to ease up the shadows on his face and to make it seem like the light is coming from the practical on the right. It was a simple 4Ft Pipeline that we flagged off from the wall and dimmed down a bit.
<br>

<br>
As you can see in this photo, the walls are actually quite bright, so reducing the luminance of the walls really adds to giving it a dark ambiance and really pulling our talent out from the background giving the shot some much needed depth. 
<br>

<br>
Here's a shot designer diagram showing how it was lit. The green coloured lights are used in this setup. The red colour show what lights were used on the reverse shot.

## Shot 2 - Reverse shot
<br>
{{< figure src="/img/gtr/2.jpg" >}}
<br>
The reverse shot, the other character of the film walks in and out of the room while talking to the main character.
<br>
She was preparing to go to a banquet of some sort or an upscale party, so I wanted to make her kind of radiate when she came in to the room. Putting an Area 48 above her just outside of frame with a snapbag and 1/2 grid cloth on gave her a great glow that really makes her shine. 
<br>
We also added a pipeline in the room behind her to bring in some ambiance for the room and turned on the ceiling lamp as it is in frame. I might have added 1/4 CTO to the pipeline, I don't remember but it does look a bit warmer than 3200k.
<br>
Not a very complex setup, but I think it works well and when you're doing the whole film in one evening you can't spend too long on each shot.

<!--## Shot 3 - Bed time
<br>
{{< figure src="/img/gtr/3.jpg" >}}
<br>
This was the 2nd to last one we did, each one getting harder and harder to find a variation with the lighting. But I like how this one ended up, the light ray on the wall behind him is a nice touch and
the wide shot has a different framing than any other shot. We did not use the wheelchair on this scene, instead we had a wide shot and then I went in for some close-ups of the guitar, the guitarist
and anything else I felt looked interesting.
<br>
For the close-ups we added a litepanel with a softbox to fill the hard shadows a bit.
<br>
This is also one of the few shots where there are no lights inside the shot. In the wide shot he's only lit with a par can from each side and then we put a dedo on the wall behind him to make it more interesting.

## Wrapping up

Thatâ€™s a quick look at how to do a simple setup in a cramped room. I hope youâ€™ve learned something. If you have any questions feel free leave a comment and Iâ€™ll answer as soon as I can!
<br>
A big thanks to Victor for trusting me with his project, and to the rest of the crew and cast for a fun shoot.
