title: Low budget car rig - mini-post
---

## First test
I've been working on a short film together with a couple of actors who are producing it independently out of their pockets, 
so the budget for this film was really low. We had a scene that took part in a car and cross-cutting with a scene in a hospital.
I wanted to get the scene shot inside the car to be more dynamic than just sitting in the passenger seat and shooting the driver, 
but we had no budget for a grip nor any gear to make a "real" car rig. So the question was how I could get the camera mounted on the outside of the car 
shooting towards the driver without any big setup.

I talked to a grip- and lighting reseller in the area about making a car rig on a low budget. I had the idea that if I shoot it on my Panasonic GH5,
suction cups should be able to hold it steadily. Together with the people at [BBS Rental Support](https://bbsrentalsupport.com/) I put together a small rig with 9.solutions parts. A very simple rig. My original idea was to use my Zhiyun Crane 2 mounted on the car to get a smooth shot. I used two [savior clamps](https://bbsrentalsupport.com/collections/123/products/savior-clamp) screwed in tightly on a [cheese plate](https://bbsrentalsupport.com/products/cheese-plate)
which was held in place on the car using three [suction cups](https://bbsrentalsupport.com/products/suction-cup-w-3-8-1-4-cheese-block)

The advantage with using the gimbal is that it keeps the horizon level automatically and panning and tilting is very easily controlled with a joystick. I could even do
it remotely using my phone.

No, that panning was not intended. Apparently the gyroscope gets very confused when the car starts to turn, so that didn't work very well. Maybe if it had a GPS built in
it could combine the data from the gyroscope and the GPS to stabilise on top of a car hood. To be fair, as long as I was going in a straight line the stabilisation worked very well and I could control the gimbal from my phone.

## Second test
Ok, let's get rid of the gimbal and just mount it directly on the cheese plate! 
<br>
I could have mounted a tripod head on the cheese plate and then the camera, but I tried to keep it as light as possible and to keep the center of mass low. So I chose to mount the camera directly on top of the cheese plate using a screw. Like so:

This is such an incredibly simple setup. A cheese plate mounted to three suction cups using rods and the camera is mounted with a screw and extra support with the rods going around and on top.

Like expected, the new rig can handle a turn without any issues. It does get bumby in the uneven road but there's not an awful lot of shaking at least at this low speed. Fortunately the scene in question did not involve any high speed pursuits or racing! I was going to go handheld inside the car anyway, so for this specific scene I knew this solution would work very well and I knew that I could set it up myself in under 10 minutes.


## Final version 

Here's how the final version looked when shooting the scene.

Of course, only do something like this on a road that you can control. We don't want anybody to cause an accident because of a camera falling of a car!
