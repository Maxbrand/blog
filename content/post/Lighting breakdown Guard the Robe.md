## Final Result
Iâ€™d love to show you the final film before the breakdown as I usually do but unfortunately itâ€™s still making the festival rounds. In light of that, Iâ€™ve added some stills.

## Introduction

Last year I shot a short about identity directed by [_Victor Von Schirach_](https://www.victorvonschirach.com/).We only had access to the location for one night, so the focus was on quick quality, all in all the location was two rooms in a hotel suite and it all takes place at night.

I'm going to break down two shots here and show how I lit them and where I placed the camera. The focus will mostly be on the lighting. This scene was mostly covered in a shot-reverse shot fashion with some inserts that I didn't do any major relighting for, so by the end of this post you should be able to copy the work I did without issues.



## The Gear
As we were in two smaller rooms and on a tight schedule, I decided that we would use mainly [BB&S Pipelines](https://bbsrentalsupport.com/collections/pipeline-system) because they are fast, easy to work with and even easier to hide.

The first thing we did, since we were going the night time look, was to block out the sunlight from the windows. So we covered them with some black cloth and flags.



### Gear list: 

#### Lighting
* 2 [Area 48 + snapbag and grid](https://bbsrentalsupport.com/collections/area-48)
* 4 [4-Foot Pipeline Raw](https://bbsrentalsupport.com/collections/pipeline-system)
* Flags and black cloth
* Practicals!


#### Camera
* [Red Epic-W 8K](http://www.red.com/products/epic-dragon)
* [Zeiss CP.2 lenses](https://www.zeiss.com/camera-lenses/us/cinematography/products/compact-prime-cp2-lenses.html)
* Tiffen ND-filters


## Shot 1 - Bathtub
<br>
{{< figure src="/img/gtr/1.jpg" >}}

Our first shot was of the main character sitting in a bathtub.
<br>
My focus in this shot was keeping the general ambiance in the room low and to focus the eye towards our main character. To do this, I used an Area 48 with grid on it as the key light, positioned from directly above. 
This gave a nice top light on the talent while keeping light spilling on the wall behind him to a minimum. I white balanced the camera somewhere around 5000k and all lights were around 3200k, to give this nice warm look.
<br>
We added some side light to ease up the shadows on his face and to make it seem like the light is coming from the practical on the right. It was a simple 4Ft Pipeline that we flagged off from the wall and dimmed down a bit.
<br>

<br>
As you can see in this photo, the walls are actually quite bright, so reducing the luminance of the walls really adds to giving it a dark ambiance and really pulling our talent out from the background giving the shot some much needed depth.

Here's a shot designer diagram showing how it was lit. The green coloured lights are used in this setup. The red colour show what lights were used on the reverse shot.

## Shot 2 - Reverse shot
<br>
{{< figure src="/img/gtr/2.jpg" >}}
<br>
The reverse shot, the other character of the film walks in and out of the room while talking to the main character.
<br>
She was preparing to go to a banquet of some sort or an upscale party, so I wanted to make her kind of radiate when she came in to the room. Putting an Area 48 above her just outside of frame with a snapbag and 1/2 grid cloth on gave her a great glow that really makes her shine. 
<br>
We also added a pipeline in the room behind her to bring in some ambiance for the room and turned on the ceiling lamp as it is in frame. I might have added 1/4 CTO to the pipeline, I don't remember but it does look a bit warmer than 3200k.
<br>
Not a very complex setup, but I think it works well and when you're doing the whole film in one evening you can't spend too long on each shot.

<!--## Shot 3 - Bed time
<br>
{{< figure src="/img/gtr/3.jpg" >}}
<br>
This was the 2nd to last one we did, each one getting harder and harder to find a variation with the lighting. But I like how this one ended up, the light ray on the wall behind him is a nice touch and
the wide shot has a different framing than any other shot. We did not use the wheelchair on this scene, instead we had a wide shot and then I went in for some close-ups of the guitar, the guitarist
and anything else I felt looked interesting.
<br>
For the close-ups we added a litepanel with a softbox to fill the hard shadows a bit.
<br>
This is also one of the few shots where there are no lights inside the shot. In the wide shot he's only lit with a par can from each side and then we put a dedo on the wall behind him to make it more interesting.

## Wrapping up

Thatâ€™s a quick look at how to do a simple setup in a cramped room. I hope youâ€™ve learned something. If you have any questions feel free leave a comment and Iâ€™ll answer as soon as I can!
<br>
A big thanks to Victor for trusting me with his project, and to the rest of the crew and cast for a fun shoot.
