## The Video
I usually want to show the final result before I get into the breakdown, unfortunately this time I cannot show it freely on the internet yet. I've added some stills instead so you can at least get a feeling of what the result was!

## Introduction

Last year I shot a short about identity directed by [_Victor Von Schirach_](https://www.victorvonschirach.com/). We shot the whole thing in one night as it was all set in two rooms in one apartment and it was a short script. 

I'm going to break down a couple of shots here and show how I lit them and where I placed the camera. The focus will mostly be on the lighting. 

## The Gear
As we were working in two quite small rooms and didn't have a lot of time I decided that we would use mainly [BB&S Pipelines](https://bbsrentalsupport.com/collections/pipeline-system) as they are fast and easy to work with and are easy to hide.

Since we were going for a dark look but we were shooting during the day, we had to get some black cloth and flags to block out the sunlight from the windows as well.

#### Gear list: 

##### Lighting
* 2 [Area 48 + snapbag and](https://bbsrentalsupport.com/collections/area-48)
* 4 [4-Foot Pipeline Raw](https://bbsrentalsupport.com/collections/pipeline-system)
* Flags and black cloth

##### Camera
* [Red Epic-W 8K](http://www.red.com/products/epic-dragon)
* [Zeiss CP.2 lenses](https://www.zeiss.com/camera-lenses/us/cinematography/products/compact-prime-cp2-lenses.html)
* Tiffen ND-filters


## Shot 1 - Bathtub
<br>
{{< figure src="/img/gtr/1.jpg" >}}

My focus in this scene was keeping the general ambiance in the room low and to focus the eye towards our main character. To do this the key light in this shot was an Area 48 with grid on it directly from above. This gave a nice top light on the talent while keeping light from spilling on the wall behind him.

<br>
As you can see in this photo, the walls are actually quite bright, so reducing the lumimance of the walls really adds to giving it a dark ambiance and really pulling our talent out from the background giving the shot some much needed depth. 
<br>
We added some side light to ease up the shadows in his face and to make it feel like the light is coming from the practical on the right. It was a simple 4Ft Pipeline that we also flagged off from the wall.

## Shot 2 - Reverse shot
<br>
{{< figure src="/img/gtr/2.jpg" >}}
<br>
For this one we added a bit of daylight to give some colour contrast with the tungsten coming from
the side. We had a bit more work to do in blocking the daylight in this shot since it was shot across
a hallway covering several rooms. To give a sense of depth we didn't fully block one of the windows so we had some light hitting the wall just in front of the guitarist. 
<br>
The daylight on the guitarist is from a Litepanel with grid on it to reduce spilling on the back wall. We dimmed down the par can and the dedo to get a very red-orange colour on his neck and face.

<br>
This one was also done on two different lenses and in the wheelchair.

## Scene 3 - Rhythm Guitar
<br>

<br>
This was the 2nd to last one we did, each one getting harder and harder to find a variation with the lighting. But I like how this one ended up, the light ray on the wall behind him is a nice touch and
the wide shot has a different framing than any other shot. We did not use the wheelchair on this scene, instead we had a wide shot and then I went in for some close-ups of the guitar, the guitarist
and anything else I felt looked interesting.
<br>
For the close-ups we added a litepanel with a softbox to fill the hard shadows a bit.
<br>
This is also one of the few shots where there are no lights inside the shot. In the wide shot he's only lit with a par can from each side and then we put a dedo on the wall behind him to make it more interesting.

## Scene 4 - Bass Guitar
<br>
{{< figure src="/img/vos/bass.jpg" >}}
<br>
Again, a simple setup but with him being framed by the doorways it makes for a good shot and with some
variation from the other shots in the video. Par can behind him, straight into the camera, blocked by the bass player giving him a real nice backlight. Again we went for some daylight to fill out the right side of his face and give some colour contrast. And once again we used a BBS Pipeline just 
outside of frame to give some front light.

## Wrapping up

That's four scenes from the music video, most of the other scenes you can make out the lighting from just looking at the video, the lights are after all in the shots! 

Thank you Najka, the band and all the rest for a fun shoot.
