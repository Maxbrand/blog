## Final Result
I usually want to show the final result before I get into the breakdown, unfortunately this time I cannot show it freely on the internet yet. I've added some stills instead so you can at least get a feeling of what the result was!

## Introduction

Last year I shot a short about identity directed by [_Victor Von Schirach_](https://www.victorvonschirach.com/). We shot the whole thing in one night as it was all set in two rooms in one apartment and it was a short script. 

I'm going to break down a two shots here and show how I lit them and where I placed the camera. The focus will mostly be on the lighting. This scene was mostly covered in a shot-reverse shot fashion with some inserts that I didn't do any major relighting for, so by the end of this post you should be able to copy the work I did without issues.

## The Gear
As we were working in two quite small rooms and didn't have a lot of time I decided that we would use mainly [BB&S Pipelines](https://bbsrentalsupport.com/collections/pipeline-system) as they are fast and easy to work with and are easy to hide.

Since we were going for a dark look but we were shooting during the day, we had to get some black cloth and flags to block out the sunlight from the windows as well.

So this shoot ended up being quite a simple setup with not that many lights involved.

## Shot 1 - Bathtub
<br>
{{< figure src="/img/gtr/1.jpg" >}}

Our first shot was this shot of the main character sitting in a bathtub.

My focus in this shot was keeping the general ambiance in the room low and to focus the eye towards our main character. To do this the key light in this shot was an Area 48 with grid on it directly from above. This gave a nice top light on the talent while keeping light from spilling on the wall behind him. I white balanced the camera at somewhere around 5000k and all lights were around 3200k, in order to give this nice warm look.

<br>
As you can see in this photo, the walls are actually quite bright, so reducing the lumimance of the walls really adds to giving it a dark ambiance and really pulling our talent out from the background giving the shot some much needed depth. 
<br>
We added some side light to ease up the shadows in his face and to make it feel like the light is coming from the practical on the right. It was a simple 4Ft Pipeline that we also flagged off from the wall.

Here's a shot designer diagram showing how it was lit. The green is this setup. The red show's what lights were used on the reverse shot.

## Shot 2 - Reverse shot
<br>
{{< figure src="/img/gtr/2.jpg" >}}
<br>
For the reverse shot the only other character in the film comes in and out of the room talking to the main character as she does so.
<br>
She was preparing to go to a banquet of some sort or an upscale party, so I wanted to make her kind of radiate when she came in to the room. Putting an Area 48 above her just outside of frame with a snapbag and 1/2 grid cloth on gave her a great glow that really makes her shine. 
<br>
We also added a pipeline in the room behind her to bring in some ambiance for the room and turned on the ceiling lamp. I might have added 1/2 CTO to it, I don't remember but it does look a bit warmer than 3200k.
<br>
Not a very complex setup, but I think it works well and when you're doing the whole film in one evening you can't spend too long on each shot.

<!--## Shot 3 - Bed time
<br>
{{< figure src="/img/gtr/3.jpg" >}}
<br>
This was the 2nd to last one we did, each one getting harder and harder to find a variation with the lighting. But I like how this one ended up, the light ray on the wall behind him is a nice touch and
the wide shot has a different framing than any other shot. We did not use the wheelchair on this scene, instead we had a wide shot and then I went in for some close-ups of the guitar, the guitarist
and anything else I felt looked interesting.
<br>
For the close-ups we added a litepanel with a softbox to fill the hard shadows a bit.
<br>
This is also one of the few shots where there are no lights inside the shot. In the wide shot he's only lit with a par can from each side and then we put a dedo on the wall behind him to make it more interesting.

## Wrapping up

That's a quick look at how to do a simple setup in a cramped room. I hope you enjoyed it and if you have any questions or anything, leave a comment and I'll answer as soon as I can!

Thank you Victor, the rest of the crew, the cast and all the rest for a fun shoot.
